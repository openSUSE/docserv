# {ds2}

{ds2} is a tool to publish and semi-automatically update large-scale documentation websites accommodating multiple products, product versions, and localizations.
It focuses on allowing publication of {db}/{ad} content that is compatible with {daps}.
However, it can also accommodate links to other sources of documents.

High notes:

* Supports HTML, PDF, Single-HTML, and EPUB output formats

* Support for localized documentation

* Documents created outside of {ds2} can be linked to from the navigational pages

* Output directory tree is all-static Web content

* Separation of build server and publishing server(s)

* Documentation sources are automatically synchronized from a remote Git repository

* Output documents can be rebuilt and synchronized to publishing servers using a simple API call

* Rigorous configuration format that prevents many errors etc.


## Installing {ds2}

RPM builds are available in the openSUSE Build Service in the link:https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Documentation:Tools[`Documentation:Tools` repository].


### openSUSE Leap 15.3

. `+++zypper ar --refresh https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Documentation:/Tools/openSUSE_Leap_15.3/Documentation:Tools.repo+++`

. `zypper in docserv`


## Dependencies

{ds2} depends on the following software:

* Linux with systemd
* Python 3.4 or higher
* `pygit2`, `lxml`
* Docker Engine
* Bash
* `xmllint`, `xsltproc`
* `xmlstarlet`
* Jing (needs a JVM)
* `daps2docker` (from https://github.com/openSUSE/daps2docker or the openSUSE Build Service's `Documentation:Tools` repository)


## Running {ds2} from the Git repository

To use {ds2}, make sure that the dependencies listed above are installed and then set up a development environment:

. Make sure the Docker service is running: `systemctl start docker`
  (To run {ds2} as a regular user, make sure your user is part of the group `docker`.)

. `cd` to the local repository checkout

. Source the dev-mode.sh script: `source dev-mode.sh`

. Make sure that the right configuration (INI) directory is chosen (defaults to the configuration directory from this repository).
To set a different one, use `export DOCSERV_CONFIG_DIR=/path/to/dir`.

. Create a virtual environment with Python: `python3 -m venv .venv`

. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`

. Update the pip Python package manager: `pip3 install -U pip setuptools`

. Install requirements via pip: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

. Install {ds2} with setuptools in develop mode: `python3 setup.py develop`


## Scripts delivered as part of {ds2}

Parts of {ds2} that can be run individually:

* `docserv`: The main build scheduling script.

* `docserv-dchash`: Reduces a {daps} DC file to its core components and creates a hash value for comparison with related DC files.

* `docserv-createconfig`: Creates draft product configuration files.

* `docserv-stitch`: Validate the {ds2} product configuration and merge it into a single big XML file (see `--help`).

* `docserv-build-navigation`: Build navigational pages for documentation content (see `--help`).
