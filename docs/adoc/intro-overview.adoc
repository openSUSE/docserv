# Overview of {ds2}

{ds2} is a tool to publish large-scale documentation websites accommodating multiple products, product versions, and localizations.
It focuses on allowing publication of {db}/{ad} content that is compatible with {daps}.
However, it can also accommodate links to other sources of documents.

The {ds2} build server is written in Python/Bash/XSLT and designed to run as a daemon.
Its Git repository is at https://github.com/openSUSE/docserv.

The following elements that are relevant to {ds2}:

* Machines:

** Git is used for versioning the sources of the content to publish.

** The {ds2} build server is the core piece of the publication process.
It builds documents and their associated navigation pages.
After building a specific piece of documentation, it copies the documentation output to a backup directory and from there to a publication server.

** The build server also provides a REST API that can be used to trigger rebuilds for documentation and check the status of those rebuilds.

** The publication server (or __target__) is the server where documentation is ultimately hosted.
There are no server-side scripts that needs to run on targets.
Therefore, any computer running a compatible Web server is suitable as a target.

* People:

** Writers create content in the form of {db} or {ad} articles, books, and sets.

** Release managers publish content by creating configuration and triggering API calls.
