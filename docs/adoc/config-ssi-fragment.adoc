# SSI fragments

Server-Side Includes (SSIs) allow centrally updating certain content and including it within plain HTML pages using an XML comment.
{ds2} can optionally use SSIs to allow translations of navigational pages.
For general information about SSIs, see link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes[Wikipedia].

To use SSIs, you must:

* Use a web server that supports SSIs (such as Apache) with the SSI feature enabled.

* Enable SSIs in the site configuration.
For information about enabling SSIs in the site configuration, see <<config-site-target-section>>.

{ds2} does not natively support plain HTML fragments.
Instead, it prefers XHTML fragments wrapped in a minimalist XML markup.
This format allows adding string placeholders which {ds2} will pick up and replace, generating localized plain-XHTML fragments.
To avoid limiting the XHTML syntax that can be used as part of it, there is intentionally no XML schema for XML-wrapped fragments.

[IMPORTANT]
.Javascript and similar content in fragments
====
Be aware that the XML-wrapped XHTML fragments must be legal XML and are handled by an XML toolchain.
Certain Javascript and similar content may need to be specially escaped.

[#config-ssi-fragment-file]
## SSI fragment file structure

A minimalist example of a fragment could look like this:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<f:fragment xmlns:f="https://github.com/openSUSE/docserv/fragment">

  <p>... any XHTML 5 content...</p>

</f:fragment>
----


[#config-ssi-fragment-feature]
## SSI fragment file format features

Besides allowing inclusion of practically all XHTML content, this format supports including the following elements, attributes and variables:

* `@force-breaks` attribute in the root element:
`<f:fragment force-breaks="yes">` makes sure that all line breaks from the original source document are included literally.
This helps generate nicely formatted HTML source where necessary.
By default, this setting is off (that is, set to `no`).

* `<f:l10n select="__[LOCALIZATION_KEY]__"/>` within the content:
Adds the translation string which `__[LOCALIZATION_KEY]__` resolves to into the generated localized fragment.
+
For example:
+
--
* Using this markup in a SSI fragment:
+
[source,html]
----
<p><f:l10n select="my-content"/></p>
----

* With `my-content` defined thus in `en-us.xml`:
+
[source,xml]
----
<content key="my-content">This is translated text content.</content>
----

* ...Yields this `en-us` output:
+
[source,html]
----
<p>This is translated text content.</p>
----
--

* `@f:l10n="__[ATTRIBUTE_NAME]__|__[LOCALIZATION_KEY]__"/>` within any XHTML element:
Adds an XHTML attribute with the name `__[ATTRIBUTE_NAME]__` into the generated localized fragment.
The value of the attribute will be the resolution of `__[LOCALIZATION_KEY]__`.
+
You can add multiple localized attributes to the same XHTML element by appending a hyphen (`-`) and a number to the attribute name.
+
For example:
+
--
* Using this markup in a SSI fragment:
+
[source,html]
----
<img src="example.png" f:l10n="alt|my-alt-text" f:l10n-2="title|my-title-text"/>
----

* With `my-alt-text` and `my-title-text` defined thus in `en-us.xml`:
+
[source,xml]
----
<content key="my-alt-text">This is alternative text.</content>
<content key="my-title-text">This is title text.</content>
----

* ...Yields this `en-us` output:
+
[source,html]
----
<img src="example.png" alt="This is alternative text." title="This is title text."/>
----
--

* `<f:comment>A comment</f:comment>` within the content:
An XML comment that needs to be kept in generated localized fragments.
All regular XML comments (`<+++!-- ... --+++>`) present in the XML-wrapped fragments will be removed from generated fragments.

* `<f:br/>` within the content:
An individual forced break.
This can be used to improve XHTML source formatting of generated fragments.

* In addition, the placeholders supported within localized content are also supported within the HTML content here.
See <<config-localization-placeholder>>.
